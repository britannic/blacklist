# Security policy

> **Note**: this policy is new and untested.
> We will update and refine it as security issues are reported

## Brand promise

Keeping users safe and secure is a top priority for us at
[**britannic/blacklist**](https://github.com/britannic/blacklist/).
We welcome the contribution of external security researchers.

## Scope

If you believe you’ve found a security issue in any software, service, or
website governed by [**britannic/blacklist**](https://github.com/britannic/blacklist/), we encourage you to notify us.

Projects governed by [**britannic/blacklist**](https://github.com/britannic/blacklist/) will sometimes be unsafe by design (such as running 
as sudo or using a dangerous option). This unsafe behaviour when explicitly
documented is not considered a security issue.

There are no hard and fast rules to determine if a bug is worth reporting as a
security issue or a “regular” issue. When in doubt, please open an 
[issue](https://github.com/britannic/blacklist/issues).

## How to submit a report

Security issues can be reported by opening an 
[issue](https://github.com/britannic/blacklist/issues),
which will be reviewed by our development team.

We will create a maintainer security advisory on GitHub to discuss internally,
and when needed, invite you to the advisory.

## Safe harbor

[**britannic/blacklist**](https://github.com/britannic/blacklist/) supports safe harbor for security researchers who:

*   Make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations, destruction of data,
    and interruption or degradation of our services
*   Only interact with accounts you own or with explicit permission of the
    account holder.
    If you do encounter Personally Identifiable Information (PII) contact us
    immediately, do not proceed with access, and immediately purge any local
    information
*   Provide us with a reasonable amount of time to resolve vulnerabilities prior
    to any disclosure to the public or a third-party
*   We will consider activities conducted consistent with this policy to
    constitute “authorised” conduct and will not pursue civil action or initiate
    a complaint to law enforcement.
    We will help to the extent we can if legal action is initiated by a third
    party against you

Please report an [issue](https://github.com/britannic/blacklist/issues) to us before engaging in conduct that may be inconsistent
with or unaddressed by this policy.

## Preferences

*   Please provide a detailed [issue](https://github.com/britannic/blacklist/issues) with reproducible steps and a clearly
    defined impact
*   Submit one vulnerability per report
*   Social engineering (such as phishing, vishing, smishing) is prohibited
