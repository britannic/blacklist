[[Top]](#contents)

### **apt-get Installation - ERLite-3, ERPoe-5, ER-X, ER-X-SFP, ER4, UniFi-Gateway-3 & UniFi-Gateway-4**

* Add the blacklist debian package repository using the router's CLI shell

```bash
configure
set system package repository blacklist components main
set system package repository blacklist description 'Britannic blacklist debian stretch repository'
set system package repository blacklist distribution stretch
set system package repository blacklist url 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/britannic/debian-repo/master/blacklist/public/'
commit;save;exit
```

* Add the GPG signing key

```bash
sudo curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/britannic/debian-repo/master/blacklist/public.key | sudo apt-key add -
```

* Update the system repositorities and install edgeos-dnsmasq-blacklist

```bash
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -f edgeos-dnsmasq-blacklist
```

* You may see reports of unmet dependencies, run this command to fix that:

```bash
apt --fix-broken install
```

[[Top]](#contents)

## **dpkg Installation - best for disk space constrained routers**

### **EdgeRouter ERLite-3, ERPoe-5, ER4, UniFi-Gateway-3 & UniFi-Gateway-4**

```bash
curl -L -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/britannic/blacklist/master/edgeos-dnsmasq-blacklist_1.2.4.9_mips.deb
sudo dpkg -i edgeos-dnsmasq-blacklist_1.2.4.9_mips.deb
```

[[Top]](#contents)

### **EdgeRouter ER-X & ER-X-SFP**

* Ensure the router has enough space, by removing unnecessary files

```bash
sudo apt-get clean cache
delete system image
```

* Now download and install the edgeos-dnsmasq-blacklist package

```bash
curl -L -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/britannic/blacklist/master/edgeos-dnsmasq-blacklist_1.2.4.9_mipsel.deb
sudo dpkg -i edgeos-dnsmasq-blacklist_1.2.4.9_mipsel.deb
```

[[Top]](#contents)

## **Upgrade**

* If the repository is set up and you are using apt-get:

```bash
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -f --only-upgrade edgeos-dnsmasq-blacklist
```

* Note, if you are using dpkg, it cannot upgrade packages, so follow these [instructions](#dpkg-installation---best-for-disk-space-constrained-routers) and the previous package version will be automatically removed before the new package version is installed

[[Top]](#contents)

## **Reconfigure**

* If the Unifi Security Gateway has been re-provisioned you might need to re-enable the blacklists, in order to do so run:

```bash
sudo dpkg-reconfigure edgeos-dnsmasq-blacklist
```

[[Top]](#contents)

## **Removal**

### **EdgeMAX - All Platforms**

```bash
sudo apt-get remove --purge edgeos-dnsmasq-blacklist
```

[[Top]](#contents)

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

### **How do I disable/enable dnsmasq blacklisting?**

* Use these CLI configure commands:
* Disable:

```bash
configure
set service dns forwarding blacklist disabled true
commit;save;exit
```

* Enable:

```bash
configure
set service dns forwarding blacklist disabled false
commit;save;exit
```

[[Top]](#contents)

### **Does the install backup my blacklist configuration before deleting it?**

* If a blacklist configuration already exists, the install routine will automatically back it up to /config/user-data/blacklist.$(date +'%FT%H%M%S').cmds

[[Top]](#contents)

### **How do I back up my blacklist configuration and restore it later?**

* use the following commands (make a note of the file name) in the shell (not in configure):

```bash
export DATE=$(date +'%FT%H%M%S'); echo "Backing up blacklist configuration to: /config/user-data/blacklist.${DATE}.cmds"; show configuration commands | grep blacklist > /config/user-data/blacklist.$(date +'%FT%H%M%S').cmds
```

* After installing the latest version, you can merge your backed up configuration:

```bash
configure
.  /config/user-data/blacklist.[date string].cmds
commit;save;exit
```

* If you prefer to delete the default configuration and restore your previous configuration, run these commands:

```bash
configure
delete service dns forwarding blacklist
.  /config/user-data/blacklist.[date string].cmds
commit;save;exit
```

[[Top]](#contents)

### **Which blacklist sources are installed by default?**

* Use these CLI shell commands to view the current sources or scan the log for previous downloads:

```bash
show configuration commands | match source
grep downloaded /var/log/update-dnsmasq.log
```

[[Top]](#contents)

### **How do I configure local file sources instead of internet based ones?**

* Use these commands to configure a local file source

```bash
set service dns forwarding blacklist hosts source myhosts description 'Blacklist file source'
set service dns forwarding blacklist hosts source myhosts dns-redirect-ip 0.0.0.0
set service dns forwarding blacklist hosts source myhosts file /config/user-data/blist.hosts.src
```

* File contents example for /config/user-data/blist.hosts.src:

```bash
gsmtop.net
click.buzzcity.net
ads.admoda.com
stats.pflexads.com
a.glcdn.co
wwww.adleads.com
ad.madvertise.de
apps.buzzcity.net

### **How do I use standalone or failover mode?**

* The update-dnsmasq binary checks for an active configuration in the following locations:
  1. Uses the EdgeOS/UniFi shell API to get the active blacklist configuration
  1. /config/config.boot (only used if -safe switch is used)
  1. /config/user-data/blacklist.failover.cfg (only used if it has been created and the -safe switch is used)

* If no configuration is found, update-dnsmasq will remove any dnsmasq blocklists it previously created

[[Top]](#contents)

### **How do I keep my USG configuration after an upgrade, provision or reboot?**

* Follow these [instructions](https://britannic.github.io/install-edgeos-packages/) on how to automatically install edgeos-dnsmasq-blacklist
* Generate and download a config.gateway.json file from your USG following these [instructions](https://help.ui.com/hc/en-us/articles/215458888-UniFi-USG-Advanced-Configuration-Using-config-gateway-json)
* Here's a sample [config.gateway.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/britannic/blacklist/master/config.gateway.json)
* Once the config.gateway.json has been generated, it will need to be uploaded to your **UniFi controller** per the [instructions](https://help.ui.com/hc/en-us/articles/215458888-UniFi-USG-Advanced-Configuration-Using-config-gateway-json)
* Alternatively follow the instructions for [how do I use standalone or failover mode?](#how-do-i-use-standalone-or-failover-mode)

[[Top]](#contents)

### **How do I add or delete sources?**

* Using the CLI configure command, to delete domains and hosts sources:

```bash
configure
delete service dns forwarding blacklist domains source malc0de
delete service dns forwarding blacklist hosts source yoyo.org
commit;save;exit
```

* To add a source, first check it can serve a text list and also note the prefix (if any) before the hosts or domains, e.g. [No Coin Filter](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hoshsadiq/adblock-nocoin-list/master/hosts.txt) has this format:

```text
#               No Coin Filter List           #
#   https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hoshsadiq/adblock-nocoin-list/master/hosts.txt   #
#         Last updated: Mon, 04 Dec 17 19:18:42 +0000      #


127.0.0.1  localhost
127.0.0.1  0koryu0.easter.ne.jp
127.0.0.1  109-204-26-16.netconnexion.managedbroadband.co.uk
127.0.0.1  1866809.securefastserver.com
```

* So the prefix is "127.0.0.1  "
* Here's how to creating the source in the CLI:

```bash
configure
set service dns forwarding blacklist hosts source nocoinfilterlist description '127.0.0.1 based host and domain list'
set service dns forwarding blacklist hosts source nocoinfilterlist prefix '127.0.0.1  '
set service dns forwarding blacklist hosts source nocoinfilterlist url 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hoshsadiq/adblock-nocoin-list/master/hosts.txt'
commit;save;exit
```

### **How do I globally exclude or include hosts or a domains?**

* Use these example commands to globally include or exclude blacklisted entries:

```bash
configure
set service dns forwarding blacklist exclude cdn.visiblemeasures.com
set service dns forwarding blacklist include www.nastywebsites.com
commit;save;exit
```

[[Top]](#contents)

### **How do I exclude or include a host or a domain?**

* Use these example commands to include or exclude blacklisted entries:

```bash
configure
set service dns forwarding blacklist domains exclude visiblemeasures.com
set service dns forwarding blacklist domains include domainsnastywebsites.com
set service dns forwarding blacklist hosts exclude cdn.visiblemeasures.com
set service dns forwarding blacklist hosts include www.nastywebsites.com
commit;save;exit
```

[[Top]](#contents)

### **How does whitelisting work?**

* dnsmasq whitelists any entries it finds in the configuration files domains and hosts (or servers) that have a hash in place of the IP address (the "#" forces dnsmasq to forward the DNS request to the router's configured nameservers)
* e.g. for servers (hosts)

```bash
server=/www.bing.com/#
```

* e.g. for domains

```bash
address=/bing.com/#
```

[[Top]](#contents)

### **Does update-dnsmasq run automatically?**

* Yes, a scheduled task is created and run daily at midnight with a random start delay is used ensure other routers in the same time zone won't overload the source servers.
* The random start delay window is configured in seconds using this command - this example sets the start delay between 1-10800 seconds (0-3 hours):

```bash
set system task-scheduler task update_blacklists executable arguments 10800
```

* It can be reconfigured using these CLI configuration commands:

```bash
set system task-scheduler task update_blacklists executable path /config/scripts/update-dnsmasq-cronjob.sh
set system task-scheduler task update_blacklists executable arguments 10800
set system task-scheduler task update_blacklists interval 1d
```

* For example, to change the execution interval to every 6 hours, use this command:

```bash
set system task-scheduler task update_blacklists interval 6h
```

* In daily use, no additional interaction with update-dnsmasq is required. By default, cron will run update-dnsmasq at midnight each day to download the blacklist sources and update the dnsmasq configuration files in /etc/dnsmasq.d. dnsmasq will automatically be reloaded after the configuration file update is completed.

[[Top]](#contents)

### **How do I use the command line switches?**

* update-dnsmasq has the following commandline switches available:

```bash
/config/scripts/update-dnsmasq -h
  -dir string
        Override dnsmasq directory (default "/etc/dnsmasq.d")
  -f <file>
        <file> # Load a config.boot file
  -h    Display help
  -safe
        Fail over to /config/user-data/blacklist.failover.cfg
  -v    Verbose display
  -version
```

[[Top]](#contents)

### **How do I configure dnsmasq?**

* dnsmasq may need to be configured to ensure blacklisting works correctly
  * Here is an example using the EdgeOS configuration shell

```bash
configure
set service dns forwarding cache-size 2048
set service dns forwarding except-interface [Your WAN i/f]
set service dns forwarding name-server [Your choice of IPv4 Internet Name-Server]
set service dns forwarding name-server [Your choice of IPv4 Internet Name-Server]
set service dns forwarding name-server [Your choice of IPv6 Internet Name-Server]
set service dns forwarding name-server [Your choice of IPv6 Internet Name-Server]
set service dns forwarding options bogus-priv
set service dns forwarding options domain-needed
set service dns forwarding options domain=mydomain.local
set service dns forwarding options enable-ra
set service dns forwarding options expand-hosts
set service dns forwarding options localise-queries
set service dns forwarding options strict-order
set service dns forwarding system
set system name-server 127.0.0.1
set system name-server '::1'
commit; save; exit
```

[[Top]](#contents)

### **What is the difference between blocking domains and hosts?**

* The difference lies in the order of update-dnsmasq's processing algorithm. Domains are processed first and take precedence over hosts, so that a blacklisted domain will force update-dnsmasq's source parser to exclude subsequent hosts from the same domain. This reduces dnsmasq's list of lookups, since it will automatically redirect hosts for a blacklisted domain.

[[Top]](#contents)

### **How do I troubleshoot dnsmasq blacklisting?**

* View last update log:

```bash
  tail /var/log/update-dnsmasq.log

  Total entries extracted = Total sites blocked
  Timestamp = Last time the update ran
```

* Manually update the dnsmasq configuration files from sources:

```bash
  sudo /config/scripts/update-dnsmasq -v
```

* Check if a domain or hostname is being blocked or manually excluded:

```bash
  grep [host.domain.tld] /etc/dnsmasq.d/*
```

* Or:

```bash
  grep [domain.tld] /etc/dnsmasq.d/* 

```

* Note: If the domain/hostname is manually excluded it will appear in one of the &ast;.whitelisted-&ast;.conf files

* Display installed edgeos-dnsmasq-blacklist version:

```bash
  sudo /config/scripts/update-dnsmasq -version
```
